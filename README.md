Many of our old IT admins still had lingering accounts on local devices, despite the fact that their accounts had been disabled/deleted. This provides the opportunity for threat actors to use stale credentials to access those devices if they cannot connect to the domain controller. I developed this script to  iterate through various OU's and wipe out those accounts thus removing the security vulnerability.
